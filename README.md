# Udacity-Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post:Airbnb-Project
<br>As part of the Udacity data science nanodegree program, I will be analyzing the Airbnb Seattle dataset.

**Packages used:**
<br>- Numpy
<br>- Pandas
<br>- Matplotlib

**Business questions:**
<br>Below are some of the questions which I will be trying to answer by end of the project:
<br>- Does price have any seasonality effect?
<br>- Does price fluctuate based on the day of the week (weekdays vs weekend)?
<br>- Do certain amenities influence the price factor?

**Datasets Used:**
<br>- listings.csv: Captures listing details such as listing id, listing urls, experience offered etc.
<br>- calendar.csv: Includes details around listing date, availability, price etc.
<br>- reviews.csv: Captures review details of every listing. It has multiple fields such as listing id, date, reviews etc.

**Acknowledgements:**
Data sourced from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

**High-level Findings:**
<br> - In June and December listing prices are relatively high. Our hypothesis would be that these months are for summer vacation and christmas, hence, the prices are higher than usual. On the other hand, prices in Q1 are significantly lower than the average for the entire year.
<br> - Friday and Saturday are the highest priced days in a week since tourists will prefer weekend for vacation over weekdays. Also, they would prefer coming back to their hometown on Sunday, hence price for Sunday is relatively on the lower side.

**Summary of the results:**
I wrote a blog post in medium which captures the summary of the entire analysis. Please find the link for the blog post:
